A machine learning system that predicts the popularity of a tweet regarding food, evaluating the popularity in relationship to the sum of the tweet's interactions. 

The paper and the development of the machine learning system was required for the course of "Machine learning and introduction to evolutionary computation", taken by professor Eric Medvet
