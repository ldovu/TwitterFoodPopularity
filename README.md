A machine learning system that predicts the popularity of a tweet regarding food, evaluating the popularity in relationship to the sum of the tweet's interactions. 

The paper and the development of the machine learning system was required for the course of "Introduction to machine learning and evolutionary robotics", taken by professor Eric Medvet 
at the University of Trieste. I passed the exam successfully (28/30).
